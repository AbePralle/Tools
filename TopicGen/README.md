# TopicGen

![TopicGen In Action](Screenshot.png)

* Takes a topic list text file and generates series of tabset images, each with a different highlighted topic.
* Uses Node JS + the npm 'puppeteer' library for saving rendered HTML as a PNG image.
* Uses Rogo for driving the overall process.
* Specialized for use in my Anecdotal Abe vlog but the tech can easily be adapted to other custom purposes.
* Only tested on macOS.
* No configuration required - just run 'rogo topics' and it's easy to work out the rest.
